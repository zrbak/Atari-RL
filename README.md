# Atari-RL
This is a Atari project that is using unique RL algorithms to train onto Atari games using only frames of pixels as input

We will start by using the openai Atari wrapper as the backend to handle the pixel inputs

The following website shows the RL algorithms tried for each game: https://paperswithcode.com/task/atari-games

We will try to explore a RL alogorithm and game that has not been attempted before and will compare performance using this website. 
Additionally, if we can find any updates to these algorithms, we can try these too


Some algorithms to look at:

Temporal Difference Learning for Model Predicitive Control (Most promising)
